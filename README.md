# LDA-AQU: Adaptive Query-guided Upsampling via Local Deformable Attention
This repository presents the official PyTorch implementation of LDA-AQU (MM2024)

In this paper, we improve the upsampling operator commonly used in dense prediction tasks. Specifically, we introduce the local self-attention mechanism into the feature upsampling task and introduce the local deformation ability to reduce the semantic gap in the feature reorganization process.
